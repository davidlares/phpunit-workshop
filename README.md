# PHPUnit workshop

This is a workshop for demonstrating PHPUnit functionality on Unit tests, Functional tests, and E2E tests based on a demo project called `gamebook`.

Check the `src/Test` directory for particular details.

1. The `Browser` directory has a PHP class for E2E tests. For this  `Selenium` and `chromedriver` were required.

2. The `Controller` directory contains functional tests

3. And the `Unit` folder has a bunch of unit tests
